# Lost-and-found
These days many of us lose our valuable items but no such proper platform is available for returning these lost items. So, it is mandatory to develop a system that can help to overcome these problems.. As this system's functionality is described here, whenever a person will lose his item, he should register and after successful login a form will appear for describing his lost item.  If someone finds a item he will go to the found section and update the details of the items. The details of found items will be stored in database along with the photo. whoever has lost the items can search in the database if his/her item has been found and updated.
